const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in  which the developers gather, analyze and document what is vital from users and other stakeholders"

const design = "This is the third step, in which developers strategize a configuration for the system(s) around addressing the requirements"

const implementation =  "This is the fourth step, in which coding begins, the developer(s) have the established design document and the Software design is converted to source code"

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which thorough trials are implemented to make sure the Software works properly, to fix any issues until it is assured the product meets the standards of the clients and customers"

const Maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers address any issues and make any adjustments necessary for enhancement or otherwise once the product has been launched"
